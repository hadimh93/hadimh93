- 👋 Hi, I’m @hadimh93
- 👀 I am a motivated data scientist with more than four years of expertise in designing, training, and fine-tuning machine-learning models. 
     I have a solid foundation in statistics, experiment design, time-series analysis, and machine learning. I have experience using predictive 
     data modeling to solve actual business challenges and presenting findings to management. I have advanced knowledge in the areas of anomaly 
     detection, natural language processing, and customer behavior analysis. I also have specialized knowledge in the construction of tuning and
     validation procedures to enhance the effectiveness and performance of AI/ML systems.
