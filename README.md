🚀 Hey there, I'm @hadimh93!

🔥 Passionate about bridging the gap between social science and artificial intelligence, I am a PhD Candidate at the Faculty of Social and Behavioral Science at Utrecht University. My work focuses on Explainable Large Language Models (LLMs) and fostering Human-AI Collaboration, with a strong emphasis on ethical AI development and social impact.

💼 Previously, I've spent over four years as a Data Scientist, where I've tackled real-world business challenges by designing, training, and fine-tuning machine learning models. My cross-industry expertise covers finance, fraud detection, anomaly detection, natural language processing, and customer behavior analysis, leveraging deep and reinforcement learning techniques. I'm highly skilled at constructing tuning and validation procedures to optimize AI/ML systems' effectiveness and performance.

🌐 I love sharing my work and engaging with the AI community - check out my GitHub account for more: [https://github.com/hadimh93]

🎯 Key Interests:

* Human-Centric Data Science 🧑‍🤝‍🧑
* Reinforcement Learning (RL) 🚀
* Explainable AI & Fairness in ML 🌈
* Natural Language Processing (NLP) 🗣️
* Data-Driven Decision Science & Optimization 🎯
* Behavioral Science & Psychology 🧠

🤝 I am always eager to connect with like-minded individuals, explore new opportunities, collaborate on projects, or exchange ideas about the ethical development and application of AI. Let's connect and make a difference together! ✨
